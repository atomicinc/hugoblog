<p><strong><em>A great business is a terrible thing to waste.</em></strong></p>
<p>For too long, the founder has seen businesses suffer from providing the wrong services, to the wrong customers, with poor results at high cost. With his passion for assisting clients, cross-industry experience, and combined product strategy, operations and technology backgrounds, we believe businesses <em>could and should</em> do better for their customers <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> themselves.</p>
<p>We want to help businesses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grow</strong>: Lay out the path for growth for new or <em>re</em>newing ventures.</li>
<li><strong>Operate</strong>: Improve operations - revenues, profits, services levels, retention and overall performance - of business units, from small three-person teams all the way up to large corporations.</li>
<li><strong>Invest</strong>: Determine the value of an investment based on the hands-on true value of the operations of the investment, within the scope of its market, personnel and finances.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have worked in multiple industry sectors, including technology, finance, real estate, pharmaceutical, health-care, hospitality, travel and food services, but we have always had <em>a special love for technology firms</em>.</p>
<p>We are a global firm with clients in North America, Europe and Asia.</p>
