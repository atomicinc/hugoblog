<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span class="clientQuery">“Is there really a market for our product or service? Is it big enough? Will it be a venture startup or a lifestyle business? Will customers buy it for a profitable price? How do I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">know</span> these to be true, rather than just guesses?” </span></em></p>
<p>Startups, both venture and lifestyle, have the highest risk but potentially the greatest reward: satisfaction, control over one's own destiny, and much greater income and wealth.
