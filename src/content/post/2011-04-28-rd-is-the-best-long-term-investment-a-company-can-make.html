<p>I could make many arguments on this, but Jeff Bezos did a great job in his letter to shareholders, <a title="published yesterday" href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9OTA4ODB8Q2hpbGRJRD0tMXxUeXBlPTM=&amp;t=1" target="_blank">published yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>Interesting aside for those who run companies that work online. If you look through the list of technologies he has implemented, significantly more than half of them, and likely a lot more than half of Amazon's R&amp;D investment on the innovation side, is in infrastructure, that platforms on which all of the software/Web applications run. In most Web companies, there is a VP R&amp;D (aka VP Technical Products) who handles all of software development, while a VP Operations (aka VP Engineering or VP Technical Services) handles all of infrastructure.</p>
<p>When Jeff Bezos says they are investing in R&amp;D, he means both sides of the room, but especially the infrastructure side. In my opinion, significant technology-derived competitive advantage comes from the nimbleness and cost savings of highly engineered and innovative infrastructure and the innovation and nimbleness in software that such infrastructure enables.</p>
