In my last article, I wrote a response to Andreesen Horowitz's [blog post from late May](https://a16z.com/2021/05/27/cost-of-cloud-paradox-market-cap-cloud-lifecycle-scale-growth-repatriation-optimization/).

I have been gratified to see how many people have read it and, more importantly, taken the time to respond, both publicly and privately.

There were two individuals who commented to me privately, with some disagreements and/or critical points on my argument. I specifically would like to restate
their arguments here, hopefully doing them justice. While I *did* engage in the debate with them in private messages, I will not do so here. I prefer to let their
arguments stand on their own. Of course, I reserve the blog-owner's right to attempt to refute them in a future post.

First, comments from [Chris Buckley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisgbuckley) from the United Kingdom. Chris has been consulting on cloud transformations
for [Virtual Clarity](https://www.virtualclarity.com/vcdxc.html), now owned by DXC, for over a decade.

Chris says the following (lightly edited for format):

> I'm not sure you're right (though for a different reason to a16z). Most of the clients I see are after the same 2 reasons as a16z suggest BUT
>
> - are ill equipped to manage dynamic cost, so it runs away from them
> - think that "going to cloud" will deliver agility, rather than enabling it
>
> i.e. they've read the cloud hype that a16z is responding to
> and in fact would have been better off at almost any scale staying on their capex model let alone at large scale.
> Now, if the clients became efficient and good at managing cloud they might optimise the costs back to good value for what they do.
> But on the whole they don't;
> they are too stuck in working the same way they used to, architecting as though they had static infrastructure and then never optimising
> (even sizing, let alone service selection and feature selection).

At the end, Chris makes a really interesting point about my bias as the article write:

> the trouble is that you only see the people smart enough to hire you ;-)

Yes, or to hire him. And he is 100% right about that bias. The companies that hire people like him or me rarely are the ones who have bought the hype and now just want to
"buy the agility"; they recognize that it is harder than just whipping out the checkbook (that imagery works much better than "authorize the wire transfer") and "buying me some
agility with cloud." For many, perhaps most, of the others, they do fall into this trap.

Chris makes some really solid points - both about corporate understanding of what change really takes and about author's bias - which, in my opinion, are worthy of articles of their own.
The "buying agility" topic is one I already am contemplating.

Second, comments from [Vasu Chandrasekhara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ðŸ‘¨%E2%80%8DðŸŒ¾-vasu-chandrasekhara-b570202/) in Germany. Vasu is the VP Cloud Native Strategy and
Chief Architect of OCTO at SAP.

Here are Vasu's remarks, again edited lightly for clarity:

> Every fortune 500 company needs to digitalize. In a sense they are all becoming software companies.
> At the same time, regulatory requirements matter. Unless you are a simpleton startup, they lurk everywhere for a company that operates in a multinational environment.
> In terms of predictability of consumption, it depends on size.
> For build vs buy, and skills with respect to COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf Software) and OSS (Open Source Software): as a large corp, you had _better_ build that capability,
> or you will be somebody else's lunch.
>
> Currently, we have experiments going on on both sides, yes, even within the same company:
> On the one hand, automobile manufacturers like VW, MB, etc. are building their own complete software platform (even Tesla). On the other hand,
> there are others joining with existing large software and operations companies like Google & Apple (in latter case, until they realized that Apple is onto an iCar :slightly_smiling_face:).
>
> When it comes to banks (at least in Germany), they are offloading and partnering with Google/AWS/Azure, but at the same time retaining their premises for regulatory purpose.
>
> There are many more such examples across industries.
>
> The comparison e.g. between software/it/infrastructure and electricity/utility, that argue for centralization/specialization do not hold true anymore, if software becomes key in your value chain.
> I today would rather argue for hybrid capabilities.

As I see it, Vasu is making several points.

First, in a much more eloquent way, he is restating Marc Andreessen's famous "software is eating the world". He extends it further
by stating that _if_ software is eating the world, then we can draw two conclusions from there:

1. Every company must treat software capabilities as core competencies. It isn't enough to simply outsource it.
1. No company can build it all on its own. It *must* rely on third-party components, whether commercial (COTS) or Open-Source (OSS).

Without both of those skillsets, you are "someone else's lunch."

Second, within every industry, from heavy manufacturers like automobiles to completely digital like financial services, there are many experiments going on as to which parts should be outsourced
and which should not. The die is not cast, the solution is not obvious.

Third, regulatory requirements matter far more greatly than most pundits give them credit.

Finally, because software and infrastructure and all of IT have become so central to the execution of each company's mission, they no longer are commodities that
can be treated as utility services.

Both of my colleagues made some really interesting points; I appreciate their sharing them with me and, more importantly, consenting to me sharing them with you.
