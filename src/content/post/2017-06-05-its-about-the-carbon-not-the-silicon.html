<p>Earlier today, I had the pleasure of speaking with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stuart-hasking-079a5b/">Stuart Hasking</a>, a colleague from my financial services IT days, and currently a strategic consultant at TESM. We were discussing the challenges in making changes in a technology environment, when he shared a great line that summarizes the issue perfectly:</p>
<blockquote><p>"It's about the carbon, not the silicon."</p></blockquote>
<p>Most people view technology - deploying servers, designing networks, writing software - and especially complex large-scale distributed technology, as hard. They are right, it <em>is</em> hard. But it is also true that most real-world technology problems have at least one, and often several, potential solutions.</p>
<p>Further, by the time you are ready to deploy a technology, the solutions don't have to be developed or built; they usually are ready for usage.</p>
<p>What, then, is the <em>real</em> challenge to deployment?</p>
<p><strong>Culture.</strong></p>
<p>The number of technologies that can bring significant benefits without changing your processes at all probably can be counted on one hand. Sure, a more efficient water boiler will save you money - provided it fits into the same space, uses the same power method, and has standard fittings.</p>
<p>Within a company, or even a family, gaining the benefits of a new technology almost <span style="text-decoration: underline;">always</span> requires changing process, which really means changing culture. The larger the company, the more people affected, the harder the cultural change.</p>
<p>In my <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/deitcher/legacy-to-cloud-fairytale-continuous-lifecycle-london-june-2017">presentation at Continuous Lifecycle London</a>, May 2017, the top three takeaways from my cloud transformation presentation were:</p>
<ol>
<li>The number one thing you are changing is culture</li>
<li>The number two thing you are changing is culture</li>
<li>The number one thing you are changing is people's lives</li>
</ol>
<p>The real skill in driving successful change at a company is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> technical or financial. Those <span style="text-decoration: underline;">have</span> to work, but they are necessary, not sufficient.</p>
<p>The real skill is with <em>people</em>: What helps them? What frightens them? What keeps them awake at night? How can they benefit?</p>
<p>Before changing technology, figure out how to help change the people, or expect it to fail. When you are ready for successful change of your technology operations, <a href='{{< ref "page/contact.html" >}}' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">call us</a>.</p>
