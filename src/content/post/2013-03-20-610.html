<p>The WSJ had a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323639604578370383939044780.html?mod=rss_mobile_uber_feed" target="_blank">great article today</a> on the challenges managers have in getting employees to take risks. It profiled a number of companies wherein they had been in survival mode for a long time, and employees had gotten used to being cautious. As one managing director told me at an overseas bank where I worked in the US operations, "the nail that stands out gets hammered." In his case, I believe it was meant to be a rebuke - I am usually the nail that stands out for advocating change and risk - but the mindset of being cautious was clearly there.</p>
<p>The article highlights the tension between being cautious to safely navigate a business through stormy waters, especially recessions and bankruptcies, and the risk-taking culture required to generate innovative change and therefore growth. Managers trying to turn a business from the first mode into the second need to find a way to reassure staff that risk-taking will be rewarded, or at least not punished. One of my earliest mentors used to <em>reward</em> employees for risk-taking that failed, and reward them <em>even more</em> for risks that succeeded. Quite simply, taking a calculated risk deserved a reward (although success deserved greater reward).</p>
<p>It is nearly impossible to have a culture that is both cautious and risk-friendly. After all, "cautious" is simply another word for "risk-averse," which is the exact opposite of "risk-friendly." A business can manage its risks, can train employees to evaluate the risk - what is the upside, what is the downside, what are the probabilities of each (basic understanding of the differences between probabilities and expectations are important - see Nassim Taleb's "Fooled by Randomness") - and how to mitigate the downside, but in the end, either employees hunger for the opportunity to take a chance on an upside, or they don't.</p>
<p>One approach is that of the new CEO of Extended Stay America, who gave out, "get out of jail free" cards. It is a nice innovative idea, but it only works if employees <em>already hunger for the risk</em>. The cards remove the personal downside, but don't incentivize the taking of risk itself. My old mentor's approach - rewarding risk-taking itself - is a somewhat better approach. Ideally, though, you simply hire people with a hunger and drive to make the world (starting with your company) better. I recently read of a company that checks to see if a prospective hire will pick up a napkin off the floor. While they are looking for how much the employee cares about the overall environment, a sense of responsibility beyond the mercenary self, part of that motivation is the desire to make the world (and office) a better place.</p>
<p>The one issue I have with the article is that it makes a big error: it assumes that risk is good only for growth, while caution is good for steadying the ship in turbulent waters. I would argue that risk is goo in <em>both</em> scenarios. During hard times, while everyone else is trying to stay afloat and getting very cautious, it is finding new sources of growth - new markets, new products, or taking market share away from competitors - is often easier than when everyone is after them.</p>
<p>I believe risk-taking is best in good times to find growth, and in bad times... to grow out of them.</p>
