<p>BusinessInsider, the sometimes good reporting site which has become more dominated by cheesy sales pitches, still has some good in-depth reporting once in a while.</p>
<p>Two of their more "veteran" (if one can use that term on such a young site) reporters did an <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-story-2013-10" target="_blank">in-depth piece</a> on the history of Twitter, or how it got from there to here. To their credit, the reporters resist the urge to idolize or simplify the process of a successful startup. They explore the trials, travails, uncertainty, and, in their own word, "chaos" that prevailed throughout many important periods in Twitter's history.</p>
<p>One of the pivotal moments was the firing of <a href="http://twitter.com/ev" target="_blank">Evan Williams</a> and his pushing for then-COO <a href="http://twitter.com/dickc" target="_blank">Dick Costolo</a> to take over. The Board had considered Costolo, but was reluctant. He was "old" by Silicon Valley standards and had never run a company larger than one third of Twitter's size - and Twitter was growing very rapidly. In the end, the Board took the plunge, and Costolo succeeded, bringing Twitter all the way to its imminent IPO of 15 November 2013.</p>
<p>It is ironic that the Board was averse to hiring someone without sufficient paper experience, despite demonstrated skill and talent. The Board of a risky startup was acting in a highly conservative manner, hiring as if it were an executive at GE or JPMC, not Twitter.</p>
<p>Most people look at the risk of doing something; it is in their nature to ask, "what if I fail?" Entrepreneurs balance the risk of <em>not doing</em> something; they are far more concerned that they are passing up an opportunity hat will not recur.</p>
<p>Given that the Board of Twitter was composed of investors and founders of a venture that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by definition</span> had only gotten that far by employees, founders and investors saying, "what if we <em>don't</em> join," it is ironic that they asked, "what if Costolo cannot handle it? He has never done it before!"</p>
<p>It is not so surprising, then, that Williams, the entrepreneur, was the one who could balance the risks and push for the talented but less experienced choice. "What if we <strong>don't</strong> take him?"</p>
