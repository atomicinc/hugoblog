<p>Yesterday, Vala Afshar tweeted out the following</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/ValaAfshar/status/706678404884652032</p>
<p>... to which <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg" target="_blank">Paul Graham</a> of YCombinator fame responded:</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/paulg/status/706710881652965376</p>
<p>I beg to disagree with Paul, but not how you would expect.</p>
<p>One of the valuable intellectual behaviours one learns from studying Talmud is to analyze a situation from all directions, teasing out all potential logical explanations, no matter how strange or absurd they appear at first.</p>
<p>If all of the following is true:</p>
<ol>
<li>A company treats employee independent control of time - their own and others' - to a greater degree than cash;</li>
<li>Time is at least as valuable a commodity as cash.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then you have two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Companies should have someone who watches over time the way CFOs watch over money." (Paul's tweet)</li>
<li>Companies should learn to <em>trust</em> employees with cash the way they do with time.</li>
</ol>
<p>I do not disagree that employee time is the most valuable commodity. I disagree that the solution is to trust employees <strong>less</strong> with time; instead we should trust them <strong>more</strong> with money.</p>
<p>Indeed, that was my response:</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/avideitcher/status/706712280973631488</p>
<p>Of course, no company trusts any level of employee with unlimited cash <em>or</em> time. A new intern cannot call a company-wide meeting; even the CEO must go to the Board to spend $1BN.</p>
<p>Yes, you want a purchasing department so that you can negotiate the best deals across the company. Yes, you want a CFO so you know how much cash you actually have on hand and manage towards strategic P&amp;L, balance sheet, and cash-flow targets.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But</span> you only will achieve those targets by your employees executing on plans and delivering. If you trust them on time, trust them to a similar degree on cash.</p>
<p>16 years ago, I was hired as VP Enterprise Management for a financial services company. At the time, we were in desperate need for a turnaround in many areas of the business. Yes, I was a VP with my own budget and approval, but it was the first time I had seen someone cut the red tape. Within a week, I went to my boss, the CIO, to ask, "how do I get travel approval?"</p>
<p>His response was classic:</p>
<blockquote><p>Get on a plane and fly. If you make a mistake, we will resolve it later.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, if I had flown First Class to Sydney, Australia, with no business there, I might have been in some hot water. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">But I still could have done it if I felt it was right</span>. He was saying, "I trust you with the company's time to do what's right, in exchange for <em>doing</em> what's right; why wouldn't I trust you with our cash?"</p>
<p>It's always been a matter of trust....</p>
