<p>Last week, I had the distinct "pleasure" of visiting the local emergency room. I managed to severely twist my leg at the end of a hockey game. My friend the orthopedist, who was with me, took a look and sent me off to get X-rays. Turns out, it was broken, and it will be many weeks before I start running or playing hockey again.</p>
<p>The interesting business part is the structure of reimbursement and incentives. On my way to the hospital, I called the ER to make sure they were open, since there were some local strikes. The kind lady at reception advised me to get a coverage commitment from my insurance <em>before</em> stepping into the hospital.</p>
<p>Apparently, if I go to the hospital, they X-ray it, and it is broken, then the insurance covers it in full. If it is not broken, I am responsible for the charges, or at least the deductible, unless I received a pre-commitment from my insurance. This is similar to many insurance plans that charge $50-75 for an ER visit, unless the patient is admitted, in which case the co-pay is waived.</p>
<p>At first blush, this surprised me. After all, if I twisted my ankle badly, wouldn't the insurance company <em>want</em> me to get it checked out? If it really is broken, and I wait too long, the damage (and hence the cost of fixing it) can be much worse!</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I went through the process of calling my insurance company's 24-hour line. The nurse walked me through a few questions, had me check a few things, and then immediately issued the waiver.</p>
<p>After I hung up, I realized that the process, although mildly inconvenient, makes a lot of sense <em>when you look at incentives</em>. ER visits can be expensive. On the one hand, an insurance company wants to eliminate <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unnecessary</span> ER visits. On the other hand, they want to expedite <span style="text-decoration: underline;">necessary</span> ER visits, so the patient doesn't get any worse.</p>
<p>Eliminating automatic ER coverage while funneling patients through a nurse-driven qualification process - a form of triage - gives the insurance company the opportunity to weed out unnecessary visits and support necessary ones. The dual system - automatic coverage in case of a break of admittance, no coverage unless pre-approved otherwise - creates the best incentives for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">both</span> the insurance company <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> the patient.</p>
<p>It may be an annoyance - after all, who wants to spend 10 minutes on the phone with a nurse when you are in pain and your leg may be broken - but it is a small price to pay to keep insurance costs down.</p>
