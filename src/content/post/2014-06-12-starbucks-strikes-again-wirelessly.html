title: Starbucks Strikes Again... Wirelessly!

<p>Just under a year ago, I <a href="{{< baseurl >}}/2013/08/01/getting-to-ubiquity-first-solve-real-pain/" target="_blank">wrote</a> how Starbucks and Apple drove adoption of WiFi. I also wrote that Starbucks was considering adopting, in its coffee shops, one of the competing wireless inductive charging standards, PMA, and not alternatives like Qi.</p>
<p>This is reminiscent of the old Beta vs. VHS wars in the 80s, and Blu-Ray vs. HD a few years ago. In the end, someone with enough weight and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">enough network impact</span> selects one, and it locks it in.</p>
<p>It looks like Starbucks' trial of PMA in a few states has been a success, and <a href="http://news.starbucks.com/news/national-rollout-of-wireless-charging-by-duracell-powermat-begins-in-starbu" target="_blank">they are now expanding nationwide</a>. The idea of being able to go into a Starbucks and not look for a free power plug - there are plenty in the newest Starbucks, but never enough in the older ones (and sometimes not even the newer ones) - is extremely attractive to anyone who is hanging out in one with friends, reading the paper, or just working.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many phones - including Apple's flagship iPhone 5S - do not have any form of wireless charging, and many others have an alternate form. But standard selection in a very widespread and heavily-used location should drive demand for that format in many phones. Apple has been waiting by the sidelines to see which wins out; while Apple could have taken sides, the last thing they need is for customers to say, "I paid how much for this phone and I cannot charge it at my favourite Starbucks?!?" Without a clear early winner and a split market, Apple probably was wise to wait it out.</p>
<p>What is next? Security. It is great to drop your phone in and charge it, but it just makes it easier for someone to walk away with it; they don't even need to unplug it. I suspect three options will arise:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alarm: An app (or built into Android/iOS) that has an option to alarm as soon as it disconnects from charging. That would certainly serve as a deterrent, especially if you have to enter your passcode/passphrase to disable it.</li>
<li>Lock: Expect some form of Kensington-type cable lock to be built into the next iteration of Starbucks cables.</li>
<li>Magnetic: Some type of connection between Starbucks app and your phone that creates a strong magnet that cannot be disconnected without it being disengaged.</li>
</ol>
<p>It should be interesting...</p>
