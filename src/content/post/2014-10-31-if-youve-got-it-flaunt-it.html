<p>In a <a title="Giving Web Chat a Human Face" href="{{< baseurl >}}/2014/10/30/giving-web-chat-a-human-face/" target="_blank">previous article</a>, I discussed how small changes can make a big difference when engaging with customers. Specifically, the addition of agent pictures to LiveChat can create a closer emotional connection between the customer and the agent, leading to higher customer satisfaction and/or increased sales.</p>
<p>Sounds like this was a low-cost investment for LiveChat with potentially a high return.</p>
<p>So... why don't they tout it? I spent some time going through LiveChat's <a href="http://www.livechatinc.com" target="_blank">Web site</a>. The Web site is good, focused, friendly and, well, fun. It even has lots of pictures of people; clearly they get the value.</p>
<p>Why don't they mention the human face benefit <em>even once</em>? Why don't they also mention how much more benefit LiveChat's customers can get from using the LiveChat system? Sure, they have stories about how "Business X gets an additional $65,000 per month in leads through the efficiency of LiveChat," or "Business Y gets an additional $3,o00." And stories matter greatly, as they help potential customers <em>see themselves and their problems</em> in LiveChat customers. Once again, LiveChat really seems to get how to make the connection in the sale.</p>
<p>But all of these stories compare email to chat, or nothing to chat. This will help customers move into the chat space, but not necessarily choose between LiveChat and its competitors. Where are the metrics showing <strong>why LiveChat, how its exclusive features lead to measurable improvements compared to competitors?</strong></p>
<p>Further, LiveChat could easily get these metrics via A/B testing. Have 50% of chats with one customer use pictures and 50% without (obviously with customer permission); do it with their own sales team on livechatinc.com. It is fairly easy for this type of system to gather the metrics needed.</p>
<p>Three possibilities exist:</p>
<ol>
<li>They didn't think of it. Hopefully this article will help drive that discussion.</li>
<li>The metrics are there but are inconclusive. I hope not, but it is a possibility.</li>
<li>They have the numbers, they are positive... but it didn't matter to customers.</li>
</ol>
<p>I find the third option least likely, but it is possible. After all, Web real estate is precious, and can only focus on so much. If some other bit of content has a stronger impact on LiveChat's sales than touting certain features, they are being rational by focusing on that content at the expense of other content.</p>
<p>I would find it interesting to know which of these isn't there. In business, if you've got it, you should flaunt it.</p>
