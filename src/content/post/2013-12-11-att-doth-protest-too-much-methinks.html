title: AT&T Doth Protest Too Much, Methinks

<p>For years - since the dawn of the American mobile industry - carriers have sold subsidized phones in exchange for multiyear contracts. Instead of paying $500 for a phone, you pay $100 or $200, and commit to staying on their network 2 years.</p>
<p>Now, out comes Randall Stephenson, AT&amp;T CEO, and whines, "<a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57615114-94/at-t-chief-we-cant-keep-doing-big-subsidies-on-phones/" target="_blank">we cannot afford to subsidize those phones anymore!</a>" Is it possible? Could AT&amp;T be losing money (or at least potential profit) by subsidizing phones? Let's take a look.</p>
<p>The latest 16GB iPhone 5S costs $649 to buy outright from Apple, but only $200 upfront from AT&amp;T with a 2-year contract. AT&amp;T is subsidizing the phone to the tune of $449. In exchange, the customer commits to two years of paying at least $60/month for the base plan, which includes unlimited nationwide talk and text and 300MB of monthly data. If you bring your own device AT&amp;T will shave $15 off your bill.</p>
<p>So how much is that phone costing AT&amp;T vs profit for them? After all, it is highly unlikely AT&amp;T would be doing the subsidy for two decades, if they did not make a nice profit on it.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T's Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is 4.22% (see the end of this article for the calculations). So the monthly financing cost to AT&amp;T over two years is $19.54. Out of the $60/month you pay AT&amp;T, just under $20 goes to finance the phone; the remaining $40 is pure plan revenue.</p>
<p>Does it cost AT&amp;T $40 to provide that basic plan? <em>Not even close</em>. AT&amp;T's company-wide cost of services (it doesn't give information by division) is about 43%. Of the $60 you paid, $25 is a cost to them to provide you with service... including the cost of the phone! So of the additional $40, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a grand total of $5 is the cost</span> to provide you with service. All of the rest is pure profit.</p>
<p>Subsidizing phones is a <strong>very good business</strong> for AT&amp;T! The last thing they want is for customers to bring their own devices. If the do:</p>
<ol>
<li>They will be much more willing to jump carriers with regularity, as the Europeans do.</li>
<li>They will be much more aggressive in demanding no-contract, post-pay, lower-price plans. For example, my Israeli carrier (I have one for every country in which I operate) charges me 100 NIS (~$29 USD) for unlimited voice, text and data, with no commitments and including all taxes and fees, as long as I bring my own device. These numbers would give AT&amp;T serious heartache.</li>
<li>They will lose the device sale relationship touch point, when they do much of their new customer sale. There is a reason that you had to activate your 2007-2008 iPhone with AT&amp;T, even when you purchased it in an Apple store.</li>
</ol>
<p>What AT&amp;T is really saying is, "We really want to raise rates. We know if we do, you will get angry and jump to other carriers. So we need to do two things: prepare you for a rate raise, and convince other carriers to raise rates as well."</p>
<p>The first is psychology; the second is constrained by antitrust law. Mr. Stephenson wants to kill two birds with one stone:</p>
<ol>
<li>By complaining about how much they are subsidizing phones, he wants to paint his company as a do-gooder from its own pockets, reluctantly forced to raise rates to keep phone subsidies in place.</li>
<li>By signalling publicly about the need - even if the reason is false - he hopes to legally signal to other carriers to raise rates as well, since he cannot collude with them directly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, both efforts are likely to fail. AT&amp;T is hated by most of its customers; a few years back, when the moniker for it was "The Evil Empire", someone photoshopped the AT&amp;T logo into the Death Star. I have no personal opinion, but customers very much do. They feel that the customer service is terrible, the prices are far too high and the company exists to mistreat them.</p>
<p>Second, there may be fewer carriers, but they all want to eat AT&amp;T's lunch. T-Mobile, in particular, has been aggressive about finding ways to make customers feel at home. As <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/10/t-mobile-rocks.html" target="_blank">uber-VC Fred Wilson said</a>, "T-Mobile is customer friendly." Or, as he quoted T-Mobile's COO, "<em>We sit around and say, ‘What can we get away with not charging the customer'?</em>" Even with a few competitors, competition works.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T is making, not losing, money on subsidies; it is making a lot more on wireless services; and it is unlikely to succeed in convincing customers to allow it to raise rates or competitors to do so with it.</p>

<p>All data is taken from <a href="http://quicktake.morningstar.com/stocknet/bonds.aspx?symbol=t" target="_blank">Morningstar</a> and <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/is?s=T+Income+Statement&amp;annual" target="_blank">Yahoo Finance</a>, as well as AT&amp;T's own filed 10Ks, and the official yields on the US Department of Treasury Web site.</p>
<ul>
<li>Equity/Value: 52.9%</li>
<li>Debt/Value: 47.1%</li>
<li>Risk Free Rate (given by yield on 10-year Treasuries): 2.81%</li>
<li>AT&amp;T Beta: 0.33</li>
<li>Market Risk Premium: 8% (historical)</li>
<li>AT&amp;T average debt yield: 4%</li>
<li>AT&amp;T effective tax rate: 29%</li>
<li>After tax debt yield: 4%*(1-29%) = 2.84%</li>
<li>Cost of equity: RFR + Beta*MRP = 2.81% + 0.33*8% = 5.45%</li>
</ul>
<p>WACC = Weight of Equity * Cost of Equity + Weight of Debt * Cost of Debt = 52.9%*5.45% + 47.1%*2.84% = 4.22%</p>
