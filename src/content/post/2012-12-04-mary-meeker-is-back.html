<p>Mary Meeker is one of the great Internet analysts out there. She was at Morgan Stanley while I worked there (and she probably added a lot more value to the firm than I ever did), so I had the pleasure of hearing her speak a few times.</p>
<p>A few years back, she joined <a href="http://kpcb.com" target="_blank">Kleiner Perkins</a> as an Investment Partner, where she puts out a once or twice a year report on Internet trends. These long presentations are worth reading, every single time. The latest report just came out and is <a href="http://kpcb.com/insights/2012-internet-trends-update" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>The big takeaways I see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile is the future, there is huge untapped opportunity there, especially in all of the spaces where mobile has not yet brought heavy usage and efficiencies.</li>
<li>There is big concern about where USA Inc is going</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone will have their own read. I very highly recommend anyone involved in the tech sector, business, education, government, or is a taxpayer anywhere (well, everyone) read it.</p>
