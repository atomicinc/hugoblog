<p>I had an interesting experience yesterday. <a href="http://twitter.com/swardley" target="_blank">Simon Wardley</a>, whom I have mentioned before as one of the best technology strategists I have read and spoken with, tweeted the following about cloud services:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Red Hat, Rackspace, HP and many many others are simply being outplayed. They all have great engineers and hopeless generals.</p>
<p>— swardley (@swardley) <a href="https://twitter.com/swardley/statuses/471712876844290048">May 28, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>I responded by asking for another write-up from Simon - I never tire of reading his analyses of technology in general and cloud in particular - but also responded that I was just now in the process of looking for a cloud offering to host a small mission-critical Web service, and agreed, once again, first-hand, with his thoughts.</p>
<p>Here is where it got interesting. I received the following tweet from an account executive at HP Cloud:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/avideitcher">@avideitcher</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/swardley">@swardley</a> can I compete for that?</p>
<p>— jash (@jashsf) <a href="https://twitter.com/jashsf/statuses/471736822008000512">May 28, 2014</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Within minutes of my replying to Simon, an account executive at HP was there asking openly if he can join in the mix. I do not know if this is an HP initiative, or a driven account executive, but either way, it is impressive. @jashsf was monitoring either Twitter in general for the right terms, or Simon in particular - which is even more impressive, since he can be pretty harsh on those companies he thinks are failing, as his original tweet shows - but either way he saw a potential opportunity in a non-traditional location and jumped all over it. Notice as well that none of the terms in Simon's tweets were hashtagged.</p>
<p>Selling to me via advertising is a sledgehammer. Reasonably well-placed digital advertising is more of a ball-peen hammer. But becoming part of an active conversation where I explicitly stated that I am in the market for such services is about as good as it gets.</p>
<p>In this case, they were not a good fit - and being part of the active conversation allowed @jashsf to qualify me out very rapidly, a crucial part of the sales process - but give him credit for doing it correctly.</p>
