<p>Let's say this: <strong>there are no magic bullets</strong>. They simply do not exist.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, your product may eliminate <em>some,</em> even some <em>important,</em> areas of pain from a customer.</p>
<p>William Mougayar, an excellent curator and writer from <a href="http://www.startupmanagement.org" target="_blank">StartupManagement.org</a>, <a href="http://startupmanagement.org/2013/08/13/the-fallacy-of-the-easy-to-use-saas-product/" target="_blank">writes</a> how even in the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) world, enterprise products can be complex to use and, indeed, <em>should</em> take time to fully entrench itself into business processes. Business processes are complex and slow to change; once you are in, it will take a very long time until they become displaced.</p>
<p>I believe that the purveyors of SaaS products confused two different types of pain caused by enterprise software: usage and deployment.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Usage: the difficulty of learning to use a new product, work it into processes or change processes to adapt to the product.</span></li>
<li>Deployment: the difficulty of scaling the product, buying new servers and network components, ordering processes, capital budget for hardware, capital budget for the software, budget cycles, new system admins, new software managers, hiring and training cycles for those people, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>SaaS, per se, <strong>only</strong> addresses the deployment pain. It converts capex into opex, it eliminates the need for servers, scaling them, dealing with purchasing and data centre management, hiring system admins and software admins, all of the <em>deployment</em> (as well as management) pain.</p>
<p>SaaS does not begin to address the <em>usage</em> pain. Yes, the "consumerization" of IT brings consumer-scale design practices and workflows to enterprise IT, which somewhat mitigates the usage pain, but that is not a SaaS question - it is as true for on-premise as for SaaS solutions.</p>
<p>Ease-of-use is not a SaaS advantage per se, and while it should be pursued in SaaS offerings as much as in on-premise offerings, it is <strong>not</strong> a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">material competitive advantage</span> of SaaS. Ease-of-deployment <strong>is</strong> a SaaS advantage per se, it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the essential</span> SaaS advantage, and one that should be pursued.</p>
<p>Always know what pain your product kills.</p>
