<p>In Seattle, south of downtown, is the National Park Service Klondike Gold Rush Museum. It is 2 floors of fascinating exhibits on the history of the 1897-1898 Klondike, Alaska, gold rush. Like most parks, they have Junior Ranger booklets and badges, and even participatory activities; my kids "panned for gold".</p>
<p>What struck me most about the entire exhibit - businessperson that I am - were the numbers on a plaque hung near the door. During the rush of 1897-1898:</p>
<ul>
<li>100,000 people traveled to the Klondike</li>
<li>30,000 (30%) actually made it to the Klondike; the rest could not manage the difficult trek of the Inside Passage plus the Chikoot and White Pass trails</li>
<li>4,000 (4%) struck any gold at all</li>
<li>300 (0.3%) earned $15,000 or more in gold</li>
</ul>
<p>$15,000 was chosen by the Park Service as the amount required to have earned a reasonable return. In other words, if you didn't earn that amount, after giving up wages and the sheer cost of travel, you might as well not have come.</p>
<p>The numbers are staggering. If you were one of 1,000 people leaving for the Klondike, <strong>only 3 of you</strong> will have gotten any  real benefit. If 100 of you were on a boat, <strong>only one person in every 3 boats</strong> would have found it worthwhile!</p>
<p><em><strong>What a phenomenal waste.</strong></em></p>
<p>The Klondike gold rush may have created some millionaires (or the late-19th-century equivalent), but for the most part it destroyed wealth as surely and as swiftly as a good market crash.</p>
