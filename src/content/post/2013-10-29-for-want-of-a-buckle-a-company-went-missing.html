<p>About two years ago, I purchased a <a href="http://www.brenthaven.com/macbook-cases/prostyle™-sleeve-i-blackcopper" target="_blank">laptop sleeve</a> with shoulder strap from Brenthaven directly from the Apple store. It fit my needs perfectly - think like a sleeve to fit into an airline carry-on, but with a shoulder strap and extra pockets to carry by itself. Barely a month after I bought it, the buckle that connects the strap to the sleeve came apart. It happens, you get a bad item, and the Apple store immediately replaced it.</p>
<p>Two years later, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">exact</span> same problem happened. One would figure it is time for a new sleeve, but Brenthaven, like Briggs &amp; Riley, offers a <a href="http://www.brenthaven.com/quality" target="_blank">no-questions-asked lifetime guarantee</a> of their bags. Just fill in the <a href="http://www.brenthaven.com/product-warranty-repair" target="_blank">form</a> on the Web site and wait for them to schedule a repair with you.</p>
<p>I did exactly that.</p>
<p>To their credit, I received an email back in <em>less than two hours</em>, on a busy Monday morning. Clearly, Brenthaven takes monitoring warranty requests very seriously.</p>
<p>To their detriment, they did <em>not</em> quite offer to repair the bag. They offered to either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have me bring the bag locally for repair, and they would give me a coupon for 50% off my next purchase. OR</li>
<li>They would send me a replacement shoulder strap (with buckle, of course), but I would have to pay $7.50 for shipping and handling.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, offering to replace the broken strap is exactly the right response; no questions asked, here is a replacement part. After all, if the whole bag isn't broken, they should be able to replace only the broken part. But asking a warranty customer to pay for shipping and handling on a warranty repair is, well, cheap. It lowers Brenthaven from a high-quality product and service company to just another bag maker, and why pay their prices if you are going to get their nickel-and-dime service?</p>
<p>After strong pushback, a manager stepped in and waived the shipping and handling. The replacement strap is on its way. But, it seems pretty clear that Brenthaven has a policy of asking warranty customers to pay for part of the repair under the "shipping and handling" guise, and if someone pushes back, then waive it.</p>
<p>It sounds like classic price discrimination - always a good thing in business - but it isn't. You discriminate on price <strong>only at the time of purchase</strong>. You never <em>ever</em> <strong>ever</strong> do so at the time of post-purchase repair. When dealing with customer service after the deal is done, you always precisely meet the expectations you have set. <strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Brenthaven wants to play in the high-quality big-boys Briggs-Riley space, who get top dollar for top-quality bags and unlimited repair service. But until they learn how real high-end quality customer service works, they have a long way to go.</p>
<p>Are your business's pricing, customer service, product quality, and marketing all aligned with each other?</p>
