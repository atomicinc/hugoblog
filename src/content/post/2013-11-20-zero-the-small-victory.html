<p>I had the pleasure of having coffee one morning this week - straight off the plane - with a colleague who recently took over all technology at a fast-moving startup.</p>
<p>This very smart technology leader is after two very big, but related, changes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Continuous Deployment: He wants lots and lots of small changes, as often as they can handle (and perhaps a little more than that). Aren't deployments risky? Sure, but as I've written before, putting two deployments together isn't twice as risky, it is 2^2 = 4 times as risky. If you deploy only once a month, you suffer that pain once a month, but the pain is orders of magnitude greater (and more damaging) than doing it in small chunks every few days.</li>
<li>Testing: To paraphrase the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061722/" target="_blank">timeless words</a> of Mr. Maguire, "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSxihhBzCjk" target="_blank">Just one word: testing</a>." It is all about testing. The more automated tests you have, the greater the confidence you have that your changes <em>actually</em> work.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the world of testing - and its more extreme but also more reliable form of Test-Driven-Development (TDD) - the number one metric you care about is "coverage." What percentage of your potential use cases and/or code is covered by tests? The ideal is 100%, although I have rarely seen organizations of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">any</span> size hit that edenic number.</p>
<p>My friend's answer to his current coverage?</p>
<p><em>"Zero... and that is a good thing."</em></p>
<p>Why, pray tell, is a big fat zero, absolutely, positively no automated tests covering any of his code or customer use cases a success, a good thing?</p>
<p>Think Alcoholics Anonymous. The first step of their famous twelve-step program, just like with any form of therapy, is to admit that you have a problem.</p>
<p>If an organization wants to change, to become better, it first needs to admit it has a problem. My colleague's first success is getting from, "we don't know and we don't care" to "we have 0% coverage." The first step of admitting a problemÂ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> its very first success, a "good thing."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
