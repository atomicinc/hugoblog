<p>A colleague of mine forwarded me <a href="http://betabeat.com/2013/10/qa-appnexus-co-founder-brian-okelley-on-getting-fired-raising-money-and-the-future-of-mobile-advertising/" target="_blank">this fascinating interview</a> with Brian O'Kelley, founding CEO of AppNexus. There are several good gems in there, and as Brian is a fairly outgoing person, the read is enjoyable as well.</p>
<p>During one particularly difficult period of raising investment, after 40 rejections, he became depressed from the rejections - common among entrepreneurs - and got fed up with all of the effort in order <em>not</em> to receive a term sheet. He decided to wear shorts and T-shirt to his next investors... most of whom gave him term sheets.In Brian's words, "My close rate with a suit on was 0 for 40 and my close rate wearing my regular clothes was like 3 for 5."</p>
<p>Brian, of course, is being facetious. After all, the T-shirts didn't <em>cause</em> the investments; they just happened at the time when he got in front of the right investors. As any science 101 student knows, "correlation does not <span style="text-decoration: underline;">necessarily</span> imply causation."</p>
<p>However, I would venture that this is a case where there actually <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> causality. Brian became fed up with the dog and pony show, and stopped dressing up for it. When someone has a mindshift like this, three important things happen at the same time:</p>
<ol>
<li>The person becomes more relaxed. The moment one stops caring what investors think, s/he projects calm confidence, which increases investor confidence, making a deal <span style="text-decoration: underline;">more</span> likely.</li>
<li>The person becomes more comfortable. Someone who is comfortable in casual clothing yet feels fake in a suit will act more natural and more confident in casual clothing, making a deal <span style="text-decoration: underline;">more</span> likely.</li>
<li>A person picks their audience. If you know investor X is formal and prefers suits, you are more likely to filter them out quickly. In sales, we call this lead qualification, and since raising venture capital <strong>is</strong> a form of sales, good lead qualification improves your deal closure rate.</li>
</ol>
<p>While Brian was joking about the shorts and T-shirt, in reality his mindset combined with his comfort level in the outfit and lead qualification very likely had a real positive impact on his success.</p>
<p>The clothes actually do make the entrepreneur.</p>
