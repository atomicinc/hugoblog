title: Between Idealism and Realism - the Rise and Fall of APIs

<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/398418407928135681" target="_blank">Benedict Evans pointed out</a> that APIs seem to be suffering death; many well-known services (in the literal, not technical, meaning) are disabling or removing their APIs - Google, Skype, etc.</p>
<p>At the same time, many other, younger services, seem to heavily promote their APIs. Facebook is not young, but it has gone through many iterations; Twitter has its API, although it has been known to get into battles with third-party services that use their APIs to compete with Twitter's own interfaces (shades of Apple?). Many truly smaller firms like SmugMug (semi-pro photography management), FreshBooks (invoicing and time-tracking) and many others expose APIs and reasonably aggressively market them, encouraging others to use them.</p>
<p>Why the contrast?</p>
<p>I believe there are two separate industries, and two competing interests within one of them.</p>
<h3>A Tale of Two Industries</h3>
<p>In the tech world, there are many ways to slice and dice industries, but in the end, it comes down to two: paid services and free services.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paid Services</span>: You go to a store, you buy a banana, you pay for it. It is a straight two-party transaction. In the tech world, Cisco, Apple, SmugMug and FreshBooks are all examples of two-party transaction business models.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Free Services</span>: In the world of free services - Google, Skype, Facebook, Twitter, StackExchange - the user of your service does <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> pay you. Rather, you offer the free services to gather a large enough user community to entice third parties, e.g. advertisers, to pay you for <em>access</em> to your user base.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are on the Web, and you get paid <em>directly</em> for usage of your services, then you have a strong incentive to open up APIs. After all, if some third-party discovers a better way to use your services, you get paid <em>even more</em>. Hence, companies like SmugMug will <strong>always</strong> want open APIs and encourage more and more usage.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are in a multiparty market, you have competing interests.</p>
<h3>Between Idealism and Realism</h3>
<p>When a multiparty market company is young, it has one overriding interest: encourage as much usage of the free services as possible. You are trying to grow a large user base: the more you offer, the more they will come; the more they come, the more you will be able to sell access at a later stage.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, many founders of such startups often have an idealistic vision of offering access to information or services to the entire world in an affordable or free manner.</p>
<p>Thus, at the early stage, the founders' idealism and the company's interests align to offer access from anywhere possible, and allow third-party developers to leverage APIs to your services, as they encourage ever more usage and a growing user base.</p>
<p>Over time, however, as the company begins to monetize its user base by selling <em>access</em>, the monetization often happens at the user interface (UI) itself, rather than the service layer. Google ads are on the top and side of the search results; Facebook ads are next to the News Feed. The UI is only one of several possible ways to get at the services; an API allows access that bypasses the UI... the very place where monetization occurs!</p>
<p>As a multiparty market company grows, the incentive to cut off APIs and allow access <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only</span> via its sanctioned (and money-making) UI grows and eventually overwhelms the idealism and growth incentives that drive API access.</p>
