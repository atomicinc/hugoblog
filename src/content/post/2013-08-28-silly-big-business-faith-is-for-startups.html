<p>Two very large companies went through a spate of trouble recently, directly related to executive moves that were, well, "faith-based" (and this coming from a religious guy).</p>
<ul>
<li>In November 2011, Apple Retail wiz Ron Johnson took over JCPenney, where same-store sales had fallen by a few percentage points. The following 3 quarters, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323894704578108573090031286.html" target="_blank">same-store sales slid</a> by 18% or more, all the way up to 27% in the quarter ending 27 Oct 2012. Unsurprisingly, Ron Johnson was not long for his job.</li>
<li>Just this week, Sears, the largest retailer of appliances in the United States, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323665504579028371672070930.html?mod=itp" target="_blank">reported</a> that its critical appliance market share had slid from 40% in 2002 to 29.9% last year. In other words, it gave up a full one-fourth of its market share, with a solid footprint and well-known and respected brand.</li>
</ul>
<p>How did these two giants stumble so badly?</p>
<p>While each did something different - JCPenney tried to end discounting, dump low-end / low-price merchandise and move upmarket, while Sears cut ties with its almost-century-long relationship with Whirlpool - both had something in common: they bet the business on faith.</p>
<p>When you are a 3-person startup, and no customers as yet, you can afford to bet the company on faith, try it, and fail. When you are a multi-billion-dollar behemoth (Sears: $7.5BN in 2012, JCP: $17BN in 2011), you <strong>don't bet the entire company</strong> on a "belief" that a completely different strategy will simply work. You <em>test</em> it. Today's startup founders, even the youngest and most inexperienced, have learned from <a href="http://theleanstartup.com" target="_blank">Eric Ries</a> and his mentor <a href="http://steveblank.com" target="_blank">Steve Blank</a> that you <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">test</span></em> your assumptions about everything from product to market to sales channels.</p>
<p>Louis D'Ambrosio (Sears) and Ron Johnson could have saved a lot of pain and embarrassment, and their investors a lot of lost capital, by just taking Steve Blank's class. It is even available for free on <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ep245" target="_blank">Udacity</a>. Or perhaps they just should have called a good consultant.</p>
