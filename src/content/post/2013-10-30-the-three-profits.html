<p>Last week, Eugene Wei, a former Amazon employee, posted an <a href="http://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2013/10/25/amazon-and-the-profitless-business-model-narrative" target="_blank">excellent article</a> called the "Amazon profitless business model fallacy." Eugene was debunking the prevalent belief that Amazon seems to be highly value despite its not making a serious profit.</p>
<p>To my mind, however, Eugene isn't debunking the "profitless business model" fallacy, he is debunking the "pundits actually know what they are talking about" fallacy.</p>
<p>There are actually three kinds of profit in business:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gross: This is what is left after you sell each item. Sell a book for $3 that cost you $2 to buy, you have $1 in gross profit, or a 33.3% gross margin. Without this kind of profit you are doomed, unless you can get it gross profit at scale and are growing quickly to get there.</li>
<li>Operating: This is what is left after you have taken all of your gross profits from all your item sales, then subtract your fixed operating costs - headquarters, administrative staff, R&amp;D, etc. If you have negative operating profit, you need to cut fixed costs or grow your unit sales until your gross profit exceeds your fixed costs.</li>
<li>Scale: This is my own term, and it describes what is left after you reduce <em>most</em> of your operating costs, but <em>exclude</em> reinvestments into rapid growth. If you have gross profit and scale profit but not operating profit <span style="text-decoration: underline;">currently</span>, then you <em>really</em> are profitable but are <em>choosing</em> to reinvest your profits (and more) into future growth.</li>
</ol>
<p>As long as Amazon is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Profitable on a <em>gross margin</em> basis; AND</li>
<li>Growing at a pace, either in its current businesses or in new ones, that it could immediately dial back that growth and become nearly-instantly highly profitable on an <em>operational basis</em>;  AND</li>
<li>Those investments in growth are paying off in providing even more revenue that is <em>gross margin</em> positive...</li>
</ol>
<p>then Amazon is not a profitless business model. It is a highly "scale profitable" business model that could become very operating profitable the moment it chooses to do so.</p>
