<p>The purpose of a business, according to guru Peter Drucker, is to "create and serve a customer." Of course, there is one missing word; it really should be, "to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">profitably</span> create and serve a customer." If the business loses money on every customer, it will not last very long. One of my favourite jokes (unfortunately not always a joke), is the CEO who says, "sure, we are losing on every sale, but we'll make it up in volume!"</p>
<p>Every business needs a <em>vision</em>; most highly successful businesses start and focus on that <em>vision</em> of the world <span style="text-decoration: underline;">from the perspective of the customer</span>. A business whose vision is, "we make a lot of money selling hammers," might make money, but will easily be undermined by competitors, who will focus on better quality, customer service and channels, solving real <em>customer</em> needs, rather than <em>company</em> needs.</p>
<p>Getting from "create and serve a <em>customer</em>" to "do so <em>profitably</em>" is a challenge faced by every visionary company. Most CEOs are really good at one side - the vision - or the other - running a profitable business. For startups and turnarounds, once a unique product/market fit is achieved, executing on vision while targeting scalable and profitable growth (or at least growth towards profit) is one of the overriding challenges facing the business.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this while reading <a href="http://on.wsj.com/1dU0Ref" target="_blank">an article</a> on how Facebook has managed Instagram since the acquisition. This shouldn't be surprising, since Facebook itself used this model - reportedly enforced by the Board over CEO Zuckerberg's head - to turn Facebook from free service that loses money to valuable free service that makes billions of dollars.</p>
<p>The pattern is the same: visionary CEO who founds a company that focuses on a clear vision centered around improving real peoples' lives. In the case of Facebook, it was sharing and connecting; in the case of Instagram, it was to "capture and share the world's moments." Either way, these are visions of a world that are highly appealing to end users, and so they have flocked to these services by their hundreds of millions. But how does such a customer-oriented visionary CEO translate that vision into profits, without losing sight of the vision?</p>
<p><strong>They don't.</strong></p>
<p>In the case of both Zuckerberg (Facebook) and Systrom (Instagram), letting the CEO continue to focus on the vision and customer is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">critical</span> to driving massive growth. Without it, both companies would have stumbled and failed (see Friendster). At the same time, hiring a powerful direct report of the CEO like COO Sandberg at Facebook and Director of Business Operations White at Instagram - and let's be honest, they really report into the Board - who can manage the <em>company</em> in its <span style="text-decoration: underline;">execution</span> of customer growth and revenue acquisition, allows the company to have a real future... fulfilling the vision of serving customers.</p>
<p>So which kind of leader are you: business or visionary?</p>
