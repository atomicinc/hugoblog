<p>Last week, HP announced its fourth-quarter results. Apparently, they were better than expected, but revenue still fell. It says a lot that a company can have <em>falling</em> revenue, and still beat expectations. What does it say about HP when analysts expect revenue to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fall even worse than it did</span>??</p>
<p>I particularly liked a <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/it-pro/business-it/hp-results-better-than-expected-but-revenue-falls-20131127-hv3un.html" target="_blank">quote in Australia's "The Age"</a> on the HP results.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"<em>HP, one of the oldest companies in Silicon Valley, was blindsided by advances like smartphones, tablets and cloud computing, all of which have hammered its core businesses...</em>"</p>
<p>Blindsided?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.gardeviance.org" target="_blank">Simon Wardley</a>, one of the top macro strategy technology consultants, has been writing about cloud's inevitability for years.</li>
<li>The iPhone has been around since 2007, but the Handspring Treo was launched in 2002, the Blackberry years earlier.</li>
<li>At least the iPad (and follow-on tablets) were quick out of the gate; HP has <em>some</em> excuse.</li>
</ul>
<p>I used to do quite a bit of business with HP when I worked as an executive in IT, and especially after their 2001 acquisition of Compaq, who made excellent data centre servers. One of the things I noticed over and over was that HP were, in some ways, like Oracle: aggressive and successful sales staff. But in other ways, they were not: their executives (and their Board) never got <em>or even cared</em> about the core product. I first noticed it during Carly Fiorina's days, but it was strong during the tenure of Mark Hurd as well as Leo Apotheker; I cannot comment from first-hand experience during Meg Whitman's two years (so far) at the helm.</p>
<p>Metrics, numbers, financials... they help you report on the state of your business and run it. But your <em>strategy</em>, your <em>future</em>, your ability to <em>do something positive with those numbers</em>, <strong>must come from the product!</strong> If you don't get the product, then you don't get <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what</span> your customers are doing, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">why</span> they are doing it, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how</span> to respond to or get ahead of your competition, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what fundamental changes threaten your entire business model</span>.</p>
<p>HP is actually getting into the cloud - they are even taking over healthcare.gov, although that is probably a bad bet for HP - but don't understand how it works and what to offer. They are using the same sales methodology without a fundamental understanding. I am aware of several cases in the last few weeks where they tried to sell customers on add-ons that would have adversely affected their security or manageability... and they want customers to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">trust them to <em>operate</em> it</span>??</p>
<p>Much ink has been spilled (can we use that phrase if it is all digital?) on Tim Cook's not being a product visionary the way Jobs was. It may or may not be true that he is not a product <em>visionary</em>, but he does fundamentally <em>get</em> Apple's products, how and why they are used and by whom.</p>
<p>Yes, HP needed to replace Apotheker with Whitman, and probably Hurd as well. But what they really needed was a change in Board-level and then executive-level mindset, that the numbers are nothing more than a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tool</span> to get insight into the performance of the business, but understanding customers and product are the key to using that tool to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">build</span> the business.</p>
