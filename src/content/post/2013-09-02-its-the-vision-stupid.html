<p>Remember Bill Clinton's great one-liner? "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_the_economy,_stupid" target="_blank">It's the Economy, Stupid</a>!" James Carville supposedly coined it to keep the Clinton campaign focused like a laser on the major issue that would win the election for Clinton against George H.W. Bush. By the way, it worked.</p>
<p>I have been thinking a lot about Microsoft lately. For a company whose name once simultaneously inspired legions and terrified equal numbers - who remembers the "Microsoft File", or the Department of Justice lawsuit - Microsoft, despite over $76BN cash on hand, a valuation of $278BN (<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=MSFT+Key+Statistics" target="_blank">source</a>), they seem to be stumbling quite a bit. Steve Ballmer has a new plan called Microsoft One, then all of the sudden he is retiring in 12 months; they are doing great, they are terrified of a proxy fight by ValueAct - who owned less than 1% of the company!</p>
<p>Even more relevant, perhaps, much of the market - public investors, private investors, venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, engineers, designers, salespeople, marketes and product managers - all view the once-most-valuable company in the world as an old elephant just waiting to fall.</p>
<p>What is Microsoft's problem?</p>
<p>Microsoft has had three core products for years. I don't care that they have Bing, or that there is Windows Phone (or whatever they are rebranding it for 2013), or that Xbox is cool; Microsoft's entire business has been built around: Windows, Office and Server. If Microsoft threw away all the rest years ago, or at least spun them out, they could have a much higher valuation right now.</p>
<p>The problem is that those three products are becoming less relevant as time goes on, and Microsoft is culturally incapable - as are most companies that have built their fortunes on a core product or service - of looking completely outside these products, let alone risking cannibalizing or actually disrupting them. And so, they have been trapped in a solar system wrapped around these three suns, spinning as the rest of the galaxy goes by.</p>
<p>How do they get out of it?</p>
<p><strong>Vision!!</strong></p>
<p>Before Microsoft looks for the next CEO, before they ask if s/he should be an operator vs technologist vs marketer vs salesperson, before they decide internal vs external, heck, before they hire a recruiting firm (oops, too late, Heidrick &amp; Struggles <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130901/one-microsoft-on-ballmer-out-valueact-in-get-ready-for-the-next-shoe-to-drop-at-microsoft/" target="_blank">has the job</a>), the Board needs to ask, "what is our Vision?"</p>
<p>Wait, you ask, isn't that the CEO's job to <em>set</em> the vision? Yes! It is! And Steve Ballmer is not a vision guy, he is a top-notch execution guy (as far as I can tell from the outside, anyways).</p>
<p>Here is what Microsoft's Board should do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Come up with some visions of the future; free-think it, it won't hurt (not too badly)!</li>
<li>Come up with some potential future outcomes, i.e. realities of those visions</li>
<li>Create an interview process for CEOs that centers entirely around two questions.
<ol>
<li>What is your future vision for Microsoft?</li>
<li>Who would you bring on board to execute it?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Is that hard work? Sure it is. Shouldn't the Board leave the hard work to the CEO? <strong>Not a chance!</strong> This is the Board's <em>fundamental job</em>. It <strong>must</strong> hire a CEO who can save the future of the company (its present is doing just fine with cash flowing in). To do that, it <b>must</b> know what future this person envisions, and if the person recognizes the boundaries between a visionary CEO vs executing executives, and how difficult it will be to change the culture at this enormous ship. I don't care if they are 30-years-old and have never done it before, or 65 with 45 years experience under the belt.</p>
<p>Reorg? <em>Only if it fits the strategy for implementing the vision.</em> Acquire Nokia or RIM? <em>Only if it fits the strategy for implementing the vision.</em> Internal vs external? <em>Only if it fits the strategy for implementing the vision.</em> "One Microsoft"? <em>Only if it fits</em>... (you get it).</p>
<p>Time for Microsoft's Board to take the bull by the horns and win the company back.</p>
