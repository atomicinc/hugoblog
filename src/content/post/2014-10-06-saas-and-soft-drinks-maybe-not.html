<p>Last week, <a title="It Isn’t Just the Product" href="{{< baseurl >}}/2014/10/03/it-isnt-just-the-product/" target="_blank">we looked at PepsiCo</a> and its channel strategy for Pepsi True.</p>
<p>A third possibility did occur to me - unsurprisingly, since I spend the bulk of my time in the technology world - that PepsiCo envied SaaS.</p>
<p>Let's look at 2 companies, PepsiCo and Salesforce (numbers as of this writing):</p>
<ul>
<li>PEP: Market cap of $139BN, revenues of $66BN, operating profit of $6.7BN, revenue multiple of 2.1, P/E of 20.89.</li>
<li>CRM: Market cap of $35BN, revenues of $4.1BN, operating loss of ~$232MM, revenue multiple of 8.5, P/E of, well, infinite.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have no real inside information, but it is safe to assume that the PepsiCo executives are intelligent, worldly and well-read people. I feel confident that they keep track not only of their own industry, but others as well, and regularly read the business pages and journals. I have no doubt that they have been watching the tech sector - they were one of the earlier companies to hire a senior executive as CISO - and understand, as the above numbers show, that tech companies get high multiples, and the recurring revenue of SaaS companies like Salesforce get even higher multiples. The multiples above - 8.5 for Salesforce vs 2.1 for PepsiCo - just reinforce it.</p>
<p>It is possible that PepsiCo's executives looked at the SaaS companies, saw their committed monthly recurring revenues (CMRR) and their impact on cash flow and valuation, and said, "<em><strong>I want that!</strong> Let's see if we can find a way to get that sort of revenue.</em>" This sort of reaction is natural for executives under pressure from shareholders who also look at those valuations and wonder why their holdings don't have the same numbers.</p>
<p>However, I discount the impact of recurring revenue here for two reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, there is no indication that Pepsi True is sold primarily, or even at all, in a "subscription-only" model. While that may happen, and Amazon does have some support for it, subscription-only soft drink is even more radical of a change than online-only, and so is likely to have been reported, if true.</li>
<li>Second, if the primary interest were subscription, PepsiCo would not sell it through Amazon, but rather directly through its own Web site. Subscription revenue - and SaaS valuations in general - depends entirely on signing up new customers, getting renewals up and churn down. You cannot do that without a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">direct customer relationship</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, it is possible that (a) the reporters missed this important bit and (b) PepsiCo doesn't understand how important the direct customer relationship is to subscription-based business models and multiples.</p>
<p>Do Pepsi's executives see the valuations? Definitely. Are they envious? Possibly; or possibly they are content to run a beverage company with a 10% operating margin and $139BN valuation. But did SaaS-envy drive the Amazon-move? Nice idea, but likely not.</p>
