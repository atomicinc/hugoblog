<p>Some time in the near future we will be publishing an article analyzing the search industry. Although it appears to everyone that there is just one big company in this business (hint: $16.6BN in revenue and $4.2BN in net income FY2007), this is an incredibly fast-moving industry. Microsoft recently attempted and failed to spend around $40BN for Yahoo, and Google itself was a nobody a decade ago.Â </p>
<p>As an advance, I recently interviewed Dr. Riza Ahmed, founder &amp; CEO of <a href="http://www.hakia.com" target="_blank">hakia</a>, based in New York, on behalf of <a href="http://www.arnoldit.com" target="_blank">ArnoldIT</a>, which itself is one of the expert firms on search. The interview is available <a href="http://www.arnoldit.com/search-wizards-speak/hakia.html" target="_blank">here</a>, with a short summary <a href="http://arnoldit.com/wordpress/2008/08/12/hakias-founder-riza-berkan-on-search/">here</a>.</p>
