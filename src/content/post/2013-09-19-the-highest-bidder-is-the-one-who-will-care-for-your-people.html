<p>Earlier this week, Josh Patrick wrote a <a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/13/its-o-k-to-sell-your-business-to-the-highest-bidder/?smid=go-share&amp;_r=1" target="_blank">great opinion piece</a> in the NY Times, entitled, "It's O.K. to Sell Your Business to the Highest Bidder."</p>
<p>Business owners often have a close emotional relationship with their business - their "baby" - and their employees, whom they view like family. In many ways, this is a positive relationship. Caring for your business, your employees and your customers is one of the best ways to get dedication and a stable, growing, going concern. If your employees sense that you, as the business <em>owner</em>, don't care much for them or the customers more than as an ATM, why would you expect them to do any better?</p>
<p>What happens when that dedicated owner decides to sell? The owner wants the business to continue to take care of the valued employees and long-standing customers, and to maintain its sterling reputation (especially if the business is eponymously named; I don't imagine Michael Dell is too happy hearing, "Dell is terrible!"). These owners often are willing to take a lower price for a buyer who will do so. I commend the <em>motivation</em>, that an owner who could sell a business for $2MM (or $200MM) is willing to give up 10% or more of their personal payout to take care of employees and customers who will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no longer be theirs</span>.</p>
<p>The problem is, it rarely works. The new buyer has no legal commitment to maintain anything, and the buyer is <strong>always</strong> purchasing the business for its own internal reasons. This new acquisition will fit in the new owner's business as the purchaser foresees, no matter what they say to the seller.</p>
<p>Patrick advocates taking the highest offer you can, since:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have no control over what the buyer will do anyways</li>
<li>The best thing for you to do is to detach emotionally from the business</li>
</ol>
<p>Get the best deal you can, as it will have <strong>zero</strong> positive impact on what happens to you and the business afterwards.</p>
<p>While I agree with Patrick, I would take it one step further. The highest offer <strong><em>is most likely to BE the one to continue your</em><em> path</em></strong>. Why would this be? The buyer wants your business for its value:</p>
<ol>
<li>The cash flow from the business</li>
<li>The higher value of your business mixed with the buyer's business</li>
<li>Some assets your business has: technology, employees ("acquihire"), customer lists.</li>
<li>They can get more cash out of your business than you can, because they can run it better.</li>
</ol>
<p>In truth, 1, 2 and 3 are all the same. They want the cash and assets in your business that are worth more to them than they are to you.</p>
<p>No matter which one you look at, you have no control. But numbers 2 - combination value - and 3 - the key assets of your business - are the situations most likely to <em>require</em> them to preserve employee and customer relationships to execute on their strategy. Ironically, those are the <strong>exact same</strong> situations most likely to lead to a higher valuation and bid.</p>
<p>So Patrick had it half-right. You should take the highest bid because it is in your own best interests and will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> <em>negatively</em> affect your employees. But you should do so <strong>because</strong> it most likely will <em>positively </em>affect your employees and customers.<em><br />
