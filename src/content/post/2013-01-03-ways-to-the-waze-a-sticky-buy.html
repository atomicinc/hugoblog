<p>TechCrunch <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/02/is-apple-plotting-a-route-to-a-waze-acquisition-rumours-on-the-road-point-to-yes/" target="_blank">reports</a> that Apple may be interested in buying social navigation (and Israeli startup) Waze.</p>
<p>None of this is surprising; if I were advising Waze (which I am not), I would have looked to Apple as a prime suitor. There area  few key reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px">Apple needs a mapping win. After the debacle of iOS Maps, followed by the wild success of Google Maps for iOS, has their <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-execs-are-seething-over-the-worlds-joyful-reaction-to-google-maps-for-iphone-writes-top-apple-blogger-2012-12" target="_blank">executives fuming</a>, it desperately needs a win in the mobile Maps space. Waze is very successful and popular.</span></li>
<li>Waze has something that neither Google nor Apple has: millions of inputs. Waze actually tracks the location and speed of the moving vehicle, and uses it as an input into its calculation of traffic-based routing.</li>
<li>Waze is very sticky.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the last point is very important. As I noted in the <a href="{{< baseurl >}}/2013/01/01/whither-freemium-where-is-google-going/" target="_blank">previous post</a>, Google has always been worried about the lack of stickiness in its search model since the beginning. Gmail was (and remains) a way to get users "stuck" on Google services.</p>
<p>Waze is sticky; it has a very strong network effect. The data is driven not by cameras or reports, but by millions of actual apps moving along roads and reporting in.</p>
<p>Apple execs must be looking at the Google suite on iOS: Gmail, Search with voice, Google Maps, Chrome, and worry users will say, "well, if everything on my iPhone is Google, might as well have my next phone be an Android." I suspect this is the prime reason iMessage remains closed to non-Apple platforms.</p>
<p>In this world, Apple probably views Waze as a win-win-win: popular maps, good data, very sticky.</p>
<p>We will see where it goes... but if Apple moves, look for a potential bidding war with Google.</p>
