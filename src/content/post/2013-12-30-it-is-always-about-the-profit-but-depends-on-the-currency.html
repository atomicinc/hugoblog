title: It Is Always About the Profit... but Depends on the Currency

<p>In my <a title="The Profit Motive… Motivates" href="{{< baseurl >}}/2013/12/26/the-profit-motive-motivates/" target="_blank">last article</a>, I looked at how the attempt to increase profits motivates people. Sometimes it leads to the wrong behaviour, but most of the time, especially in a competitive environment where customers have real choices, it leads to the right behaviour. This is the reason why I so rarely have worked with non-profits; they so often have a strong <em>disincentive</em> to improve.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JLM73TX" target="_blank">Jeffrey L. Minch</a>, a longtime entrepreneur, CEO, and professional executive coach, pointed out in an extremely insightful comment:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"Profit motives make the world go round.  You just have to figure out what currency you're trading in."</em></p>
<p>I am a lifelong student of incentives and motivations. I constantly use them in my practice to help clients figure out:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to encourage desired behaviours and outcomes from employees;</li>
<li>Why customers behave a certain way;</li>
<li>How to align sales with the rest of the company;</li>
<li>Just about everything people do inside, outside and in relation to the company.</li>
</ul>
<p>But as a consultant mostly to for-profit businesses, I am used to looking at financial incentives as a key part of the picture: price for customers; salary and bonus for employees; benefits. Sure, I always look at intrinsic motivators like pride, promotion, recognition, emotional needs, but these are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">part</span> of the picture. The primary currency is, well, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cash</span>.</p>
<p>Jeff correctly points out that in places where cash is <em>by definition</em> not a primary currency, like non-profits and government, where the "non-profitness" is imbued in the very DNA and culture of the place, the lack of cash profit motive creates an absence, and nature abhors a vacuum. The gap will be filled, but by a currency <em>other than cash</em>. Once you understand what that currency is, you can understand the incentives and motivators of the employees, customers and other stakeholders.</p>
