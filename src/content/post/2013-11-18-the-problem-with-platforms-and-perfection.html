<p>What happened to Apple? Everyone either loves them and talks of their inevitable ongoing success, or loves to hate them, and talk of their impending implosion.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, well-known Harvard professor Larry Lessig <a href="http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/65697513808/on-the-pathological-way-apple-deals-with-its-customers" target="_blank">wrote an extensive article</a> listing his travails with upgrading OS X, iOS and iWork all in the same week. Of course, upgrading everything at once is probably a bad idea, but Lessig admits it openly.</p>
<p>Apple appears to have run particularly afoul of bad customer management - essentially real product management - since its latest upgrades.</p>
<p>While Lessig takes a serious swipe at Apple's mishandling of its customers, it appears to have fallen afoul of two tensions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Platform adoption vs network exclusivity</li>
<li>Product perfection vs customer support</li>
</ol>
<h3>Platform Adoption vs Network Exclusivity</h3>
<p>iOS <em>used</em> to be a platform for others' services, and Google <em>used</em> to be a Web services company. As those once-close partners, have encroached each other's territories - Google with Android and Apple with its (somewhat pathetic) iCloud - each has tried to steer its customers entirely into its own walled garden.</p>
<p>Apple is now dependent on iOS as a platform for its iCloud services. It has an interest in using iOS as a wedge to get customers onto iCloud. This is understandable, but if you make the experience with other services <em>too</em> difficult, customers who <em>want</em> to stay with Gmail or Drive or Dropbox will abandon iOS, and <strong>not</strong> those other services.</p>
<p>It is human nature: when someone makes you choose between "her or me," you become angry at being forced to choose and take it out on the one who forced you (Apple), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">even if you are rationally better off the other way around</span>.</p>
<h3>Product Perfection vs Customer Support</h3>
<p>Apple built its products around the near-perfect customer experience. Do that for long enough, and you begin to <em>believe</em> that everything <b>will always</b> just work, and so you have no need to communicate problems - in advance or after the fact - with customers, because there <em>will be</em> <em>none</em>.</p>
<p>That culture works really well, and saves lots of money, when you actually put out a near-perfect experience. But the moment you stumble - and everyone inevitably does - your past ease-of-use and the culture it engenders <span style="text-decoration: underline;">becomes a handicap</span>, as you no longer have the organizational structure and muscle memory to manage the experience.</p>
<p>Like Soviet Coach Viktor Tikhonov in the 1980 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_on_Ice" target="_blank">Miracle on Ice</a>, if you are used to always winning, you don't know how to come back when you actually start losing.</p>
<p>Here's hoping they are reading Lessig's article - and mine - and beginning to learn how to work with their customers again.</p>
