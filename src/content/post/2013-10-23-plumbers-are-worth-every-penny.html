<p>There is a common pattern I see over and over again in fast-growth companies:</p>
<ol>
<li>Release the minimum product to get some traction. <strong>GOOD</strong></li>
<li>Get traction and revenue and grow. <strong>GOOD</strong></li>
<li>Focus on feature functionality to grow quickly, deferring "maintenance work." <strong>NOT SO GOOD</strong></li>
<li>Product begins to crack under the scale for which it wasn't designed. <strong>BAD</strong></li>
<li>Scream for help. <strong>NECESSARY</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Every edifice requires basic plumbing work - at the outset and on an ongoing basis. It is true for a house; it is true for an apartment building; it is true for an office tower; and it is true for a company.</p>
<p>Poor plumbing will lead to leaks, and eventually risk the entire building.</p>
<p>This is precisely what happened to Knight Capital. Last week, the SEC filed an <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2013/34-70694.pdf" target="_blank">18-page complaint</a> - fascinating and required reading for <em>anyone</em> in the finance or technology business.</p>
<p>Knight has an automated trading system. In the summer of 2012, Knight deployed a new version of their software, and made two assumptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The software had been properly deployed to all 8 of their servers.</li>
<li>An old unused indicator called a "flag" (like a checkbox on a paper form) could be reused now that the software was deployed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of these proved erroneous. The software had been copied <span style="text-decoration: underline;">manually</span> to only 7 of the 8 servers, which meant that the flag would trigger massive unintended purchases and sales.</p>
<p>The SEC complaint states that the problem was Knight's risk controls, and in some ways they were right: having a second technician review the deployment probably would have caught the issue.</p>
<p>But at heart, the problem was poor plumbing. Knight did not invest in <em>automation</em> and <em>testing</em> so that turning the new software on or reusing the old flag became <span style="text-decoration: underline;">impossible</span> unless everything was safe. It is highly likely Knight was reluctant to invest precious capital in "non-feature-functionality" technology, like testing and automated deployments, that would have no immediate revenue impact.</p>
<p>In short, it didn't want plumbers, it wanted fancy new toilets.</p>
<p>Plumbers are expensive, but they are far cheaper than exploded pipes that can bring down your building.</p>
